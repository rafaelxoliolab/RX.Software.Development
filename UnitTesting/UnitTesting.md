# Unit Testing

A unit test is a piece of code that can check whether another code is working as expected.
Developers must write code to assert one or more conditions that must be met by the test.

What does a unit test check?
A unit test checks the functionality of the smallest testable elements of an application―classes and functions―which allows developers to spot the failure and isolate it. 
Unit tests prove that given some input, the function returns the expected output. 
A collection of unit tests makes up a test suite.

Who is responsible for writing unit tests?
Unlike many other types of testing, unit tests must be written and updated by the same developers who write and adjust the application code.


Benefits
- Unit testing allows developers to keep the maintainability high.
- A better understanding of component functionality
- Unit tests improve the code’s design by compelling developers to create testable components
