To keep all project documents in one location that every team member can access, your team should have a common knowledge base: a Wiki, Confluence space, or other space that your team or organization chooses. It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the space up to date.

Make sure your team’s knowledge base contains:

The project goal and description
The project team structure and roles
Links to project resources
Links to environments
Project standards, rules, and conventions (for all competencies: Managers, Developers, Quality Assurance Engineers (QA), Business Analysts (BA), DevOps Engineers, etc.)
The development process description (branching, release process, task life cycle, etc.)


Best Practices for Knowledge Sharing
Establish a knowledge sharing process among development team members.
Use a technical knowledge base stored in a collaboration system (Confluence, Wiki, etc.).
Keep the technical knowledge base up to date, so it properly reflects the current project details.
Ensure team members pick development tasks for all parts of the system evenly to prevent situations where some parts of the system are known by only one person (Bus Factor > 1).
Support your project onboarding with a newcomer’s handbook or guide that covers the project system, teams, and development setup.
Update the handbook so that it properly reflects the current project details.
Coach or mentor newcomers throughout the onboarding period.
