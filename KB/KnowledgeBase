To keep all project documents in one location that every team member can access, your team should have a common knowledge base: a Wiki, Confluence space, or other space that your team or organization chooses. It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the space up to date.

Make sure your team’s knowledge base contains:

The project goal and description
The project team structure and roles
Links to project resources
Links to environments
Project standards, rules, and conventions (for all competencies: Managers, Developers, Quality Assurance Engineers (QA), Business Analysts (BA), DevOps Engineers, etc.)
The development process description (branching, release process, task life cycle, etc.)
