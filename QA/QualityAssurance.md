# Quality Assurance

## Benefits
- The product should have complete functionality and should operate seamlessly across multiple devices, platforms, and operating systems.
- Products should not only meet but also consistently exceed user expectations.
- Finding bugs early in the QA and testing process is paramount to reduce costs.

## Types of Testing

The testing process includes different types fos testing like:  functional, non-functional, manual, and automated testing

- **Manual Testing**
  - This testing type requires the developer or test engineer to create test environments to detect any bugs or errors before a release.
  - This process is done without the use of any tools or automation, so expertise is needed.
 

- **Automated Testing**
  - Determine if the application meets the client’s requirements
  - This testing uses a specific set of automated tools to complete testing tasks.
  - Developers or specialists on your team may choose automated testing for repetitive tests or for large-scale tests that would be difficult for manual testers.
  - Automated testing is repeatable, quick, and creative.
 
- **Functional Testing**
  - Functional testing focuses only on whether or not the system is working as intended.
  - Functional testing can be both automated and manual.
 
- **Non-Functional Testing**
  - Describes operational qualities rather than behavioral qualities—not what the system will do but how the system will do it.
  - Verifies how well the system meets these requirements by measuring its performance, usability, reliability, etc.
 
## Testing Methods

- White Box Testing
  - Also known as structural testing.
    White box testing is unit-level testing that ensures that the software application’s internal performance aligns with the product’s specifications.

- Black box testing
  - This is used to test the functionality of the application.
  - This testing is focused only on the interface and does not test the internal structure of the software.
 
- Grey box testing
  - This a hybrid of white box and black box testing that requires engineers to have access to the database and design documentation
 

## Errors, Failures, and Defects

- Errors
  - Errors are mistakes made by a developer while writing the software code, including any possible misunderstandings of the requirements or intended functionality.
 
- Failures
  - A failure means that the application code is not functioning or is unable to function as the developers or clients intended.
  - In this case, the developer may not have made a mistake, but the code must be reconfigured to meet the requirements of the product.

- Defects
  - A defect, also known as a bug or fault, happens when the code does not produce an expected result.
  - A defect could result in an interruption of the user experience.
 
## Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

1. Requirement Analysis
- Before testing can begin, your team must determine which requirements of the software application must be tested.
- Involve clients in this discussion to be sure you understand their expectations as well.

1. Test Planning
- During this stage, the QA team must establish the testing plan, including priorities, goals, strategy, and resources.
