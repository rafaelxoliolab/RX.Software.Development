# Quality Assurance

## Benefits
- The product should have complete functionality and should operate seamlessly across multiple devices, platforms, and operating systems.
- Products should not only meet but also consistently exceed user expectations.
- Finding bugs early in the QA and testing process is paramount to reduce costs.

## Types of Testing

The testing process includes different types fos testing like:  functional, non-functional, manual, and automated testing

- **Manual Testing**
  - This testing type requires the developer or test engineer to create test environments to detect any bugs or errors before a release.
  - This process is done without the use of any tools or automation, so expertise is needed.
 

- **Automated Testing**
  - Determine if the application meets the client’s requirements
  - This testing uses a specific set of automated tools to complete testing tasks.
  - Developers or specialists on your team may choose automated testing for repetitive tests or for large-scale tests that would be difficult for manual testers.
  - Automated testing is repeatable, quick, and creative.
 
- **Functional Testing**
  - Functional testing focuses only on whether or not the system is working as intended.
  - Functional testing can be both automated and manual.
 
- **Non-Functional Testing**
  - Describes operational qualities rather than behavioral qualities—not what the system will do but how the system will do it.
  - Verifies how well the system meets these requirements by measuring its performance, usability, reliability, etc.
 
## Testing Methods

- White Box Testing
  - Also known as structural testing.
    White box testing is unit-level testing that ensures that the software application’s internal performance aligns with the product’s specifications.

- Black box testing
  - This is used to test the functionality of the application.
  - This testing is focused only on the interface and does not test the internal structure of the software.
 
- Grey box testing
  - This a hybrid of white box and black box testing that requires engineers to have access to the database and design documentation
